# Music-Subscription-Customer-Churn-Project
Semester-long project for the course Business Analytics with R

KKBox is one of the most popular music streaming services in Asia with several subscription options to
attract customers. Nowadays, companies are increasingly aware of the importance of subscription services,
and the churn rate is a critical indicator to track the health of a subscription-based company. To be
more precise, the company can take measures in advance by predicting the customer churn rate to retain
customers consistently. Therefore, the goal is to help KKBox predict whether a subscriber will churn after
his/her subscription expires.

R was used to perform data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, and data preprocessing. Additionally,
R was used to develop a Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree Classification model, and a Random Forest
Classification model.
